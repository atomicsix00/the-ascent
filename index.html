                summary: "In a culture saturated with sensuality, a man's godliness is directly tied to his purity. It requires a deliberate, disciplined effort to guard one's heart and mind against both overt and subtle temptations, understanding that holiness is God's will and the foundation of spiritual power.",
                principles: [
                    { title: 'The Danger of "Legal" Sensualities', content: 'The greatest threat often comes from culturally acceptable indulgences—like indiscriminate TV watching or coarse humor—that desensitize the heart and make it vulnerable to greater sin. King David\'s downfall began with socially permitted sensuality.' },
                    { title: 'The Forgetfulness of Lust', content: 'When lust takes control, God loses His reality in the moment. The longer a man stares, the less real God becomes, along with his own holy calling and the consequences of sin. Lust thrives on a forgetfulness of God.' },
                    { title: 'The Will of God: Holiness', content: '1 Thessalonians 4:3-8 makes it clear: God\'s will is our sanctification. This includes avoiding sexual immorality and controlling our bodies in a way that is holy and honorable. To reject this is to reject God, who gives His Holy Spirit.' },
                    { title: 'Building Protective Hedges', content: 'Practical disciplines are essential.
